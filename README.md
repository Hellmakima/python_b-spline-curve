# B-Spline Curves with Pygame

This project demonstrates drawing Bezier curves using Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python.

## Description

The project allows you to draw points on a Pygame window by clicking with the mouse. It then constructs and displays Bezier curves based on these points using various techniques:

- **Bezier Curve**: A curve defined by a start end and two control points.
- **B-Spline Curve**: A continuous curve with multiple control points drawn using Bezier curves.

_honestly doesn't deserve to be a whole repo._

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: get pygame and run the program.
2. **Add Control Points**: Click on the Pygame window to add control points. These points will define the Bezier curve.
3. **Tweak parameters**: Adjust the parameters to change the smoothness and other settings.

## Example

Here's a screenshot of the program in action:
